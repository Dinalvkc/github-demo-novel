chapter 1:
Understand branch history
Now it's time to make a change to the code. It's common to have multiple active branches when working on different features in parallel. This is in stark contrast to CVCS where new branches are heavy and rarely created. The first step is to checkout to a new branch using the following command:

git checkout -b cool-new-feature

This is a shortcut combining two commands:

git branch cool-new-feature to create the branch
git checkout cool-new-feature to begin working in the branch
